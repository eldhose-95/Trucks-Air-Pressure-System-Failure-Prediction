The Air Pressure System (APS) is an essential part of a heavy duty vehicle, where compressed air causes the piston to apply pressure on the brake pads to slow down the vehicle.

The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. These are failure cases of the trucks during operation, and our task is to predict whether a given failure is caused due to a specific component of the Air Pressure System. This may help in avoiding failure during truck operation and thereby reducing maintenance cost.
